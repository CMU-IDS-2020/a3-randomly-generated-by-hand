## Project Goals

To pose compelling questions and create effective visualizations, we thought it would be helpful to identify a target audience first. Our target audience is the product team at Yelp, and they are interested in knowing **“what are some new opportunities to personalize a diner’s experience while researching restaurants?”** The following questions are then used to help guide the product team to explore different areas where they may introduce new features:

- On average, when do diners check in to restaurants across different cities? 
- What type of cuisines are we likely to find in this city?
- How effective are the reviews of top Yelpers for diners  researching restaurants?
- Is there a relationship between adjectives reviewers use ( funny, cool, useful, etc.) and the star ratings they give to a restaurant?  

## Design

TODO: **A rationale for your design decisions.** How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?

## Development

TODO: **An overview of your development process.** Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?
