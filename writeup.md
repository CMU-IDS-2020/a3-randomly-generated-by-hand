## Project Goals

To pose compelling questions and create effective visualizations, we thought it would be helpful to identify a target audience first. Our target audience is the product team at Yelp, and they would be interested in questions like, **“what are some new opportunities to personalize a diner’s experience while researching restaurants?”** The following questions are  used to guide the product team to explore different factors that may influence a diner’s restaurant research journey.

Goal: Find potential data points to highlight for restaurant researchers  navigating dining in a new city:
- What type of cuisines are we likely to find in this city?
- On average, when do diners check in to restaurants across different cities? 

Goal: Understand the influence of review reactions, ratings, and Yelp influencers on restaurant researchers. 
- How impactful are the reviews of top Yelpers for diners researching restaurants?
- Is there a relationship between adjectives reviewers use ( funny, cool, useful, etc.) and the star ratings they give to a restaurant?
