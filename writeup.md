## Project Goals

To pose compelling questions and create effective visualizations, we thought it would be helpful to identify a target audience first. Our target audience is the product team at Yelp, and they would be interested in exploring questions like: “What are some opportunities to present useful information for users researching restaurants on Yelp?” There are many types of information a user considers in navigating their restaurant research. For this project, we decided to explore two kinds of information that are essential in users’ research journey: Restaurant characteristics and Yelp community reviews.
Restaurant characteristics:
The information that falls in this category describes the operational side of restaurants  and the kind of food they serve. When users start their research journey, they could be presented with a large quantity of options in a city. Considering different restaurant characteristics is a necessary step users take to narrow down on options and not feel overwhelmed. Below questions explores a few restaurant characteristics:
What type of cuisines are we likely to find in this city?
What are the peak hours of this restaurant in a given day?
Yelp community reviews:
Input from the Yelp community in the form of text reviews, star ratings, and upvotes also play a significant role in helping users navigate their restaurant search.  Below questions present opportunities for exploratory analyses, looking at their prominence over time and relationship to each other.
What words are most frequently used to describe different cuisine types?
How has user appreciation for “cool”, “useful”, and “funny” reviews changed over the years? 
Is there a relationship between adjectives reviewers use ( funny, cool, useful, etc.) and the star ratings they give to a restaurant? 



## Design

TODO: **A rationale for your design decisions.** How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?

## Development

TODO: **An overview of your development process.** Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?
